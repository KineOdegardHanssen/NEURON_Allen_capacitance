# NEURON_Allen_capacitance

The scripts write to certain folders, so take a look at the scripts before printing and make sure that these folders are present.

Typically:
*There is one type of script that runs NEURON (test_allen...,ball_and_stick...,somaonly)
*There is one type of script that analyses these results (manual_analysis..., thresholds_...,findthr...)
*There is one type of script that plots the results of the analysis (plottogether...,gather_fI...)
